# NetworkBlocks
Asset manager, inventory, IPAM, config management and monitoring for network devices (and servers).

NetworkBlocks will be a web application we can use to manage all devices in our network. It will have:
1. **Asset Management**: keep record of all your assets, when and where they were bought, current price, location, ...
2. **Inventory**: 
   1. List of all devices currently installed in your network with their management IP, vendor, models, location.
   2. Locations, datacenters.
   3. Environments.
4. **Documentation**: store the documentation of each element (devices, environments, ...) with the element itself.
5. **Monitoring**: monitor all network devices.
6. **Config Management**: build templates to maintain standard configuration of devices.
7. **IPAM**: manage you IP address space.
8. **Autoprovisioning**: build network devices using standards defined in config management.
